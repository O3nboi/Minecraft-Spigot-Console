# Minecraft-Spigot-Console
Dependencies:
Java 8 or above,
Python,
Git (Not strictly necessary)
Step 1:
Run the python script in its own folder. DO NOT attempt to use this in an existing folder with multiple subfolders.
Step 2:
Type in the Server name and desired version.
Step 3:
If this is the 1st time using the specific version you chose, the spigot build process WILL take a while. This tool is not developed by me, If it shows an error, I cannot help you.
Step 4: once the server finishes loading, you can join it by opening minecraft and connecting to your IP address.
I am not an expert. The original version was made in a day. This may not be flawless.
